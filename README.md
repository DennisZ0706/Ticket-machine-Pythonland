# Ticket machine Pythonland

## The App

This cash register app is specially designed for Pythonland cashiers to quickly calculate what visitors have to pay when they want to enter the park. The prices in Pythonland depend on age and group size, so this was quite a calculation.

With this app all the staff needs to do is enter the size of the incoming group or family and the age of each groupmember into the application and the program will do the rest.

## How it works

Start by clicking on the “Klik hier” button and enter the size of the group in the mesage box that appears after clicking. 

Then enter the age of the first group member in the input field and click on "Voer In". Then do the same for all other group members. If an entered age is incorrect, "Herstel" can be pressed to restore the last entered age.

When the last age is entered, press “Bevestig” to get an overview of the order. If the entered data is not correct you can click on “Opnieuw” to re-enter the order. If everything is correct, press "Bestellen" to print the ticket.
